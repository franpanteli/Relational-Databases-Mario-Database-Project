# Relational-Databases-Building-a-Boilerplate-Project

I was independently completing [the second project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-relational-databases-by-building-a-mario-database/build-a-mario-database) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/), to improve my development skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided project courses, increasing in complexity. My notes outlining the curriculum content for these projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Building-a-Boilerplate-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the second project I completed as part of this. For this, I had to [INSERT FROM HERE] create boilerplate code for a website, only using the terminal. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Building-a-Boilerplate-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). To complete this, I cloned the tutorial guide in a Gitpod environment and completed 170 Bash lessons. I created notes on the commands I executed when doing so, which are found [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Building-a-Boilerplate-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-guided-course-notes.txt). By following the project-guided tutorial, I created the boilerplate code for the website project, by only using Bash. The files this produced are found in the `website-boilerplate` directory in this repository ([here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Building-a-Boilerplate-Project/tree/main/website-boilerplate)). The file tree for my results from this is below.
