# Relational-Databases-Mario-Database-Project

I was independently completing [the second project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-relational-databases-by-building-a-mario-database/build-a-mario-database) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/), to improve my development skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided project courses, increasing in complexity. My notes outlining the curriculum content for these projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Mario-Database-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the second project I completed as part of this. For this, I got to create a relational database filled with video game characters, using PostgreSQL. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Mario-Database-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). To complete this, I cloned the tutorial guide in a Gitpod environment and completed 165 SQL lessons. I created notes on the commands I executed when doing so, which are in depth and found [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Mario-Database-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-Mario-database-guided-course-notes.txt). By following the project-guided tutorial, I created a relational database of Mario characters. The files this produced use CodeRoad and are found in this repository.
