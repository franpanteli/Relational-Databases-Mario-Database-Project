These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Build a Mario Database." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-relational-databases-by-building-a-mario-database/build-a-mario-database  

- This project is about creating a PostgreSQL database:
	-> We are filling this database with Mario video game characters
	-> There are 165 lessons in this <- the first project was ~170, but this content is more complex 
	-> The environment that this project is completed in is the same as with the previous project in the course  

- To run the project: 
	Open the Gitpod environment:
		-> We are using a virtual Linux machine 
		-> This is run with Gitpod <- like VSCode, but in the browser 
		-> On the webpage that these notes are made on, you click "start the course" 
		-> This opens a Gitpod environment 

	Then you start the CodeRoad extension: 
		-> Click the "hamburger" menu at the top LHS of the Gitpod window 
		-> Then click the "View" menu 
		-> Click on the "Command Palette" option 
		-> Then run "CodeRoad: Start"
		-> Then you follow the instructions in CodeRoad and complete the guided project 

	-> They want you to complete it in their environment, so when it is submitted integration tests can run 
	-> You need to complete the entire guided project in Gitpod, while you are logged onto the freeCodeCamp UI - or your progress won't be logged
